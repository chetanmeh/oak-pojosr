Oak PojoSR
==========

This module demonstrates running Oak outside of OSGi environments but using in built OSGi
support for configuring Oak. It makes use of [PojoSR][1] to provide the OSGi framework
support. This would enable usage of Oak in POJO env and would still enable usage of OSGi features
to customize Oak components
